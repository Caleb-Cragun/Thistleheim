                        Professor Damion Benedikt, a communications enthusiast, 
                        and teacher at the illustrious Miskatonic University. 
                        His teaching career there allows us to have access to 
                        several restricted texts that we wouldn't normally have
                        any access to. He is a linguistics professor and has
                        helped us to translate several dead languages and old
                        texts to allow us access to the world of the weird and
                        strange so we can help the people of this world.
